Unit tests are small tests focused on testing a piece of functionality within a contract.


The following is an example of a unit test, written to test the [increment contract]. The contract has an `increment` function, that increases a counter value by one on every invocation. The following test invokes that contract's function several times, and checks that the value increases by one.

```rust
#![cfg(test)]

use super::{IncrementContract, IncrementContractClient};
use soroban_sdk::Env;

#[test]
fn test() {
    let env = Env::default();
    let contract_id = env.register_contract(None, IncrementContract);
    let client = IncrementContractClient::new(&env, &contract_id);

    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 1);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 2);
    assert_eq!(client.increment(), 3);
}
```

Most tests, even integration tests or even fuzz tests, will look very similar to this unit test. They'll create an environment (`Env`), register the contract to be tested, and then invoke its functions using its client.
